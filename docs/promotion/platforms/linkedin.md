Performance optimization in Python: When NumPy is overkill

In data engineering, we often need fast array operations but don't need 
NumPy's full feature set. For 1D numeric data, there's a lighter option.

**The Challenge:**
Python's array.array is memory-efficient but slow. NumPy solves this 
but adds significant overhead and dependencies.

**The Solution:**
arrayops provides Rust-accelerated operations directly on array.array:
• 10-100x faster than pure Python
• Zero dependencies
• Works with array.array, numpy (1D), memoryview, Arrow

**Real-World Impact:**
ETL pipelines using arrayops see 50-100x speedups on array operations 
without adding NumPy as a dependency - reducing deployment complexity 
and memory footprint.

Perfect for: ETL pipelines, binary data processing, embedded systems, 
and performance-critical scripts.

### Template 3: Case Study Post

```
Case Study: Optimizing Python Data Processing with Rust

I recently optimized a Python ETL pipeline that was processing millions 
of numeric arrays. Here's what I learned:

**The Problem:**
Processing large CSV files with numeric arrays was taking too long. 
Pure Python operations were the bottleneck.

**The Approach:**
Implemented arrayops, a Rust-accelerated library for Python arrays, 
to speed up array operations without adding NumPy as a dependency.

**The Results:**
• Processing time: 50s → 1s (50x speedup)
• Memory usage: Reduced (zero-copy operations)
• Dependencies: None added (arrayops has zero deps)
• Code changes: Minimal (drop-in replacement)

**Key Learnings:**
• Rust-Python interop is powerful for performance
• Zero dependencies reduces deployment complexity
• Good documentation is critical for adoption

### Example 2: Industry Insight

```
In data engineering, choosing the right tool matters.

For 1D numeric array processing, you have options:
• Pure Python: Simple but slow
• NumPy: Powerful but heavyweight
• Rust extensions: Fast and lightweight

arrayops falls in the third category - Rust-accelerated operations 
for Python arrays with zero dependencies.

**When it makes sense:**
✅ ETL pipelines with large numeric arrays
✅ Binary data processing
✅ Performance-critical scripts
✅ When NumPy is overkill

**Benefits:**
• 10-100x faster than pure Python
• No dependencies (unlike NumPy)
• Production ready (1.0.0, 100% test coverage)
